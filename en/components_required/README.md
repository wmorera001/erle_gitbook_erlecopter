# Components required

###What You’ll Need

#####LiPo batteries and charger

Erle-Copter requires a rechargeable lithium polymer (LiPo) battery. A good rule of thumb is to use 1,000 mAH (milliamp hours) per motor. For a Quad copter, a 4,000 mAH LiPo like this one would work well. While your copter can use only one battery at a time, we recommend having at least two batteries in stock; more batteries means more flight time. You’ll also need a charging station for your batteries such as this one.

#####Autopilot hardware with GPS module

Your copter’s autopilot determines its capabilities for autonomous flight.

#####6+ channel RC transmitter and receiver

You’ll need a radio control setup to manually control your copter and to activate its automatic modes. You can use any RC transmitter/receiver system with at least six channels.

#####Ground station software

Configuring your missions is easy with ground station sotfware: free, open-source software compatible with APM:Copter. You’ll need to install [Mission Planner](http://planner.ardupilot.com/), [QGroundStation](http://www.qgroundcontrol.org/) or on a ground station computer. Using Mission Planner in the field makes changing your mission parameters fast and easy, so we recommend selecting a laptop or tablet as your ground station.

#####Multicopter frame including motors, ESCs and propellers

- [**Power module**](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/power_mod/): The Power Module incorporates both a way to power your autopilot, accessories and report battery voltage and current to the PXF. All thru a single and tightly included 6-pin cable that directly matches the PXF’s connector. The on-board switching regulator outputs 5.3V at a maximum of 2.25A, and can be used up to 18 Volts (4S LiPo) and at a maximum of 90 amps. The Power Module is ready to use with XT60 connectors pre-fitted, and shrink wrapped for protection.
- [**ESC**](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/electronic_speed_controller/): An electronic speed control or ESC is an electronic circuit with the purpose to vary an servo-motor's speed, its direction and possibly also to act as a dynamic brake. ESCs are often used on motors essentially providing an electronically-generated three-phase electric power low voltage source of energy for the motor. It also allows much smoother and more precise variation of motor speed in a far more efficient manner than the mechanical type with a resistive coil and moving arm once in common use.
- [**Brushless motors**](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/motors/): Brushless DC electric motor (BLDC motors, BL motors) also known as electronically commutated motors (ECMs, EC motors) are synchronous motors  powered by a DC electric source via an integrated inverter/switching power supply, which produces an AC electric signal to drive the motor. Additional sensors and electronics control the inverter output amplitude and waveform (and therefore percent of DC bus usage/efficiency) and frequency (i.e. rotor speed).
- [**Propellers**](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/propellers-10x4-5-ccw/): Aircraft propellers or airscrews convert rotary motion from piston engines, turboprops or electric motors (our case) to provide propulsive force. They may be fixed or variable pitch, but our copters use the fixed type. Early aircraft propellers were carved by hand from solid or laminated wood with later propellers being constructed from metal. The most modern propeller designs use high-technology composite materials.
